            <h2 class="ch">NUPRAPTOR IN BLOOD OMEN</h2>
            <p><img src="charimg/nuraptor/1.jpg" width="233" height="175" class="mid"/></p>
            <p>In <strong>Blood Omen</strong>,  Nupraptor was the Guardian of the Pillar of the Mind. He was a master  of telepathy and telekinesis, and pilgrims would travel across Nosgoth  to visit him. He was 'hypersensitive to peoples' emotions and  thoughts'. He was also 'prone to rash action and sometimes  unpredictable and illogical decision making', but passionately loyal to  people he cared about.¹</p>
            <p>Before <b>Kain</b>'s birth, Nupraptor had been the lover of <b>Ariel</b>,  the Balance Guardian. Apparently he adored her. When Ariel was  murdered, Nupraptor plunged into a turmoil of suspicion and grief,  suspecting treachery within the Circle itself. He went mad, and  unleashed a telepathic shockwave on his fellow Guardians, infecting  them all with his insanity. The Guardians' symbiotic link, which  normally bound them together into a strong whole, served to bring down  the entire Circle. The Pillars of Nosgoth began to collapse, reflecting  their Guardians' derangement.</p>
            <p>Madness affected the  Guardians in different ways. Nupraptor withdrew into his retreat. It  was an imposing skull-shaped building, located on a cliff top above <b>Vasserbunde</b>.  In his self-imposed solitude, he mutilated himself, &quot;sewing his eyes  and lips shut to deny the outside world.&quot; The Mentalist turned on his  own servants, the pilgrims entered but did not leave the retreat, and  he was regarded as a lunatic by Vasserbünde's citizens.</p>
            <p>When  Kain - as a fledgling vampire - first visited the Pillars, Ariel told  him about Nupraptor. Kain then sought the Mentalist, intending to kill  him. He entered Nupraptor's Retreat, and eventually he found Nupraptor  with <b>Malek</b>.  Luckily, Malek was quickly dismissed - the Mentalist did not want his  protection. Kain judged Nupraptor as a &quot;broken, pathetic little man&quot;.  His head was bulbous and deformed; his green upper-cranium pulsated. He  never moved from his chair, &quot;yet crippled as he was, he would not yield  without battle&quot;. Part of this battle included teleportation, and the  Mentalist telekinetically controlling skulls to circle and shield him,  then launching them across the room to hit Kain. Kain fought Nupraptor,  decapitated him, and claimed the Guardian's severed head. He returned  the grisly trophy to the Pillar of the Mind, thus restoring it  (Nupraptor's head was his <b>Pillar token</b>). However, Nupraptor's influence on Kain's destiny did not end there.</p>
            <p>After  slaying the remaining Guardians, Kain discovered that he was Ariel's  replacement. He was the representative of the Pillar of Balance, born  as she died. Like the rest of the Circle, he had been corrupted by  Nupraptor's magic. Kain realized that he would carry the effect of the  Mentalist's madness for the rest of his life...</p>
            <h2 class="ch">NUPRAPTOR IN SOUL REAVER 2</h2>
            <p>Nupraptor was mentioned twice in <strong>Soul Reaver 2</strong>,  firstly by Kain at the Pillars. Having travelled back in time, Kain  described the murder of Ariel and the resulting derangement of the  Circle as it was happening. <b>Raziel</b> witnessed the corruption of the Pillars as the dark waves of  Nupraptor's psychic attack swept across the clearing. Old Kain tensed  and looked a bit unsteady as he weathered the blast, although it didn't  seem to affect him beyond that - all the damage that could be done to  him had already been inflicted on his newborn self. The effect of  Nupraptor's magic was not cumulative.</p>
            <p>The second mention  of Nupraptor came when Raziel met Ariel at the toppled Pillars, over a  century later. When she asked him to be merciful, and stop 'hounding'  her (he had followed her into the Spectral Realm), he cruelly asked if  she meant the brand of mercy she showed her &quot;beloved Nupraptor&quot; when  she &quot;made him Kain's first kill&quot;.</p>
            <h2 class="ch">FURTHER OBSERVATIONS</h2>
            <p>It is worth noting that the Players section of the <strong>Silicon Knights Blood Omen FAQ</strong> claims Nupraptor had singled out <b>Mortanius</b> as Ariel's murderer. This was <em>before</em> he wreaked his indiscriminate retribution on all of the Guardians. Also, it <em>was</em> intentional retribution as suggested by <strong>Blood Omen</strong>, and not just an uncontrolled overflow of Nupraptor's madness, as could have been inferred from Kain's <strong>Soul Reaver 2</strong> description. Nupraptor might have attacked the whole Circle like this,  knowing that he could never strike Mortanius directly; the Necromancer  was too powerful for that. The same source says: 'All across Nosgoth,  the minds of the sensitive and intellectual are blasted by relentless  waves of hatred', hinting that Nupraptor's attack might have affected  quite a few people outside of the Circle too.</p>
